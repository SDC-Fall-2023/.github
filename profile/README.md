# SDC-Projects Fall 2023
Welcome to SDC Projects Fall 2023! Everything you need for working through Software Development Club Projects is right here in this repository! If you have not been added to this organization, please contact one or both of the VPs of Engineering at abbharadwaj@wisc.edu or lcanderson4@wisc.edu.

### If you have not applied to be a part of the projects and are interested in doing so this semester, please [apply here](https://forms.gle/SjSmhZEZ3N18EkeZ9)!
This form is due **Sunday 10/01, 11:59 p.m.** Forms submitted after this date may be considered if you reach out to a VP of Engineering.

### Important Notes
* All projects will utilize GitHub - go [make an account](https://github.com/login) if you do not have one. Why? Because the industry revolves around Git and GitHub, and it makes collaborating with your teammates substantially easier. You will need an account for later classes anyway, and for showcasing personal projects to employers. *GitHub also allows developers to host non-commercial websites for free using GitHub pages*
* You can request to work with other people - there is a box for it on the google form.

### Group Selection
Groups will be done by request, shared interest, and skill level as much as possible. Extra information on the google form helps with that process.

### Project Meetings
Project meetings are every other Sunday at 5 p.m. unless we say otherwise. They will generally have two parts, the first part being the VPs of Engineering giving a briefing on how far along the project should be, and/or information that is relevant at the time. Information such as an example of how we would break a project into components to be done, or how to develop interfaces and plan out a project etc. The second part, is meeting with your group and having a bit of work time - this also serves as a great time to ask any questions you have or to bounce ideas off other groups.

## Timeline (Sundays)
Project Meetings are every other non-break week starting **9/24** besides the presentation day

### About the Timeline
We will discuss each of the parts of the timeline in more detail during our project meetings. Keep in mind, this timeline is only a guideline, and feel free to work at your own pace!

## Creating a Project
Project Leaders:
- Go to the Project-Template repository
- Click on Use This Template/Create New Repository
- Switch owner to SDC-Fall-2023
- Name the Repository \<Project Level\>-Team-\<Project #\>, or for example "Beginner-Team-1"
- Create the Repository
- Go to Settings/Access/Collaborators and add the rest of your team members

## How To Be Successful
* It is strongly recommend that you meet with your group weekly - find a time everyone can talk. This weekly meeting can include our in-person project meetings. This is most important in the beginning of the semester when a lot of design decisions are being made.
* Lean towards overestimating how much time a component will need - finishing early means you can work on additional bonus components without worrying about time.
* Make a schedule and stick to it as best as you can - it makes balancing class work, entertainment, and extracurricular activities a much better time.
* Put in consistent work rather than putting it off and not getting to it.
* Communicate! We are here to help you guys in any capacity we can.

## Parting Thoughts
Projects are a chance to engage with your peers, learn how to work in a team, experience taking on responsibility and leadership, and work on your development skills. This makes these projects a fantastic opportunity for growth; however, they only provide as much as we put into them. In addition to that, they are extracurricular in nature, and everyone understands that classes can become overwhelming and take priority. If it is the case that you no longer wish to work on a project, please communicate with your point of contact that is the case.
